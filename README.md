# DSKit

A collection of helpers across the Swift Language, UIKit and SwiftUI.

## Installation

Swift Package Manager is a tool for managing the distribution of Swift code. Itâ€™s integrated with the Swift build system to automate the process of downloading, compiling, and linking dependencies.

To integrate DSKit into your Xcode project using Swift Package Manager, add it to the dependencies value of your Package.swift:

```swift
dependencies: [
     .package(url: "https://github.com/doublesymmetry/DSKit.git", .upToNextMajor(from: "0.0.1"))
]
```

Or via Xcode: click `File / Swift Packages / Add package dependency...`. In the textfield "Enter package repository URL", write `https://github.com/doublesymmetry/DSKit` and press Next twice
